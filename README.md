# Automated Short Form Content Generation. //update coming soon 

## Extract and Download popular sections of shows uploaded to youtube.

## Add subtitles using free ai (Whisper)
You can find the required files in the \cc\ folder  
You need the following software in order to use these scripts:  

> Image Magick - https://imagemagick.org/index.php

> Ffmpeg - https://ffmpeg.org/
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It also still requires some other python libraries. I'm too lazy right now to add these to the README.

Use the following commands to generate subtitles:

`python caption_gen.py "input_vid.mp4"`  
`python subtitler.py "input_vid.mp4" "output.srt"`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> caption_gen.py will generate a file with subtitles called 'output.srt'
